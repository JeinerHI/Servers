## When switching to Cloude, stucked in the port 53 issue
```prompt
Hi, I'm trying to setup a dns server in my computer with dnsmasq, and after some steps that I've done by my own, I'm facing many issues rn. Probably I think some issues might be because before It I was experimenting with bind9 to setup another dns server. Now I'd need you to please guide me step by step to finish the setup properly.
